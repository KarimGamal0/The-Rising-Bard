  - 'Darkness creeps in, all that once was bright and beautiful is now defiled. 
    Everything seems dull and tasteless.  '
  - Even the sound of happiness has disappeared.
  - City of guardians was a city known for its strong warriors and great melodies.
  - It was told that these melodies had a healing power and magical effects that
    made rivers flow and plants grow.
  - Now, all is lost,
  - 'for Haru the demon of darkness had arrived. He took over the city, pillaged
    its people and took them to himself. '
  - He deprived the lands of all melodies and light.
  - The once prideful people of this city are now powerless against him.
  - Falling day by day into his influence and deforming into the music of darkness.
  - What now?
  - What about our last hope?
  - The first bard of this kingdom?Ash
  - as the legend tells, was the one who introduced music to this city.
  - 'One stroke of his mandoline could bend time and enchant minds. Where is he now? '
  - Buried in the dungeon of heroes, underground.  Can he be resurrected?
  - Yes? So here we go.  Using the last power of melodies the citizens could master,
    they collaborate to bring Ash back to life.
